# the chiptumor city

the only autobiographical site about your beloved chiptumor.

i began working on this for fun back in like late 2024 and its gone through many
iterations since. initially it was a simple markdown file but i took some time
to learn html then css and now im fucking around with javascript nonstop!! only
recently did i figure out how to use vite and its cool as hell ^_^
