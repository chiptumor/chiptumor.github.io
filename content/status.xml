		<p>
			i got the fuckin status and announcement stuff to work!!!
		</p>
		<p>
			instead of changing it directly in the main page itself, im storing
			it in an external file and slapping it here
		</p>
		<p>
			the big benefit of this is that i dont have to change the date every
			time!! i also check when the file was last updated and slap that
			under here too
		</p>
		<p>
			youll notice that with the announcements too :<small>3</small> !!
