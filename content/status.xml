            ive managed to brush off a few ordeals and ive taken a good chunk of time to
            better my mental health. had a long beautiful conversation with a good friend of
            mine and i feel much better about the outcome of everything ive dealt with
        </p>
        <p>
            i also spent some time setting up things on my phone and car so i can call with
            friends or listen to music on a drive :oD
        </p>
        <p>
            im also taking some time to learn java so i can write cool databases and
            backends when i eventually get into that :&rceil;
        </p>
