		<h2>This page is a work in progress.</h2>
		<p>
			Above is (probably) a console, and below is possibly disfunctional or unstyled
			content. Whatever happens, things will <i>not</i> look right.
		</p>
		<p>
			For now, don't follow any instructions below about debugging. I don't need it.
			They're only there as the default texts in the future case that the scripts for
			those <i>should</i> work, but don't.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extra notes:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Some links don't look quite right when you hover over them. I'll
				figure out how I wanna style those eventually.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, the todo list doesn't work yet. Ignore that.
			</p>
