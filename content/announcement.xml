		<h2>This site is a work in progress.</h2>
		<p>
			This page and/or other pages may be unstyled or completely dysfunctional. Give
			me some grace while I get things workin'.

			<summary>Mac, iOS / WebKit</summary>

			<p>
				If you're having any issues on Safari or iOS in general, please do me a favor
				and help me diagnose errors. I do not have access to my own Mac, and I
				desperately need the help.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you don't already have the console enabled, and you're on a Mac:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Open Safari
				</li>
				<li>
					In the menubar at the top, navigate to
					<b>Safari</b> &#8594; <b>Preferences</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					Select the <b>Advanced</b> tab
				</li>
				<li>
					At the bottom, enable <b>Show features for web developers</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You should then be able to open the console by navigating, in the menubar, to
				<b>Develop</b> &#8594; <b>Show JavaScript Console</b>, or pressing
				<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you've done that, try refreshing a few times, once or twice without cache
				(<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>), take some screenshots of
				the errors you encounter, and send them to me at
				<span data-copy="chiptumor">chiptumor</span> on Discord!
			</p>
		</details> -->

			Extra notes:

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				I'm touchin' up on some stuff and makin' an attempt to get the music player to
				work. I'm mostly just foolin' around now until stuff works.
