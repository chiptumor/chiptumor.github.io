		<h2>This page is a work in progress.</h2>
		<p>
			Above is (probably) a console, and below is possibly disfunctional or unstyled
			content. Whatever happens, things will <i>not</i> look right.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extra notes:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				There's some content in the boxes that need expanding or shortening, but other
				than that, it's just the music player now.
			</p>
			<p>
				After that, and fixing the god damned webkit issues, the main page will be
				functionally complete, and I'll get to work on the blog.
