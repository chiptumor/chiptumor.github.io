		<h2>This site is a work in progress.</h2>
		<p>
			This page and/or other pages are unstyled or completely dysfunctional. Give me
			some grace while I get things workin'.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extra notes:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				There's some content in the boxes that need expanding or shortening, but other
				than that, it's just the music player now.
			</p>
			<p>
				After that, and fixing the god damned webkit issues, the main page will be
				functionally complete, and I'll get to work on the blog.
