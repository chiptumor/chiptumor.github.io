        <h2>This site is a work-in-progress.</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently getting things set up, so things will not look right. Namely:
            <ul>
                <li>The socials panel isn't styled at all</li>
                <li>The socials panel doesn't have much content</li>
                <li>The projects panel doesn't have any content</li>
                <li>The to-do list template isn't replaced</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please keep this in mind as you scroll down.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's also some things I need help with, if you may please!:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When <a href="#status">#status</a> overflows enough,
                    <a href="#welcome">#welcome</a> is sized with it
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            #status's height should be less than or exactly #welcome's height; #status's
                            max-height should match the height of #welcome
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The content within #status (#status div.content) should become scrollable when
                            overflowing
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
