		<h1>Fake blog post</h1>
		<p>
			This is not a real post! This will be scrapped when I get blog posts working for
			real.
		</p>
		<h2>What it tests</h2>
		<p>This lets me test a <i>plethora</i> of <u>element</u> <b>styles</b>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Headings</li>
			<li>Lists</li>
			<li>Inline styling</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I could go on and on!</p>
		<h3>More headings</h3>
		<p>As you've noticed, heading numero tres also works out.</p>
		<p>There's some more headings I could try, like:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Heading 4</li>
			<li>Heading 5</li>
			<li>Heading 6</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			But I rarely use these. Maybe heading 4, if I fuck up my presentation a bit. For
			example:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Complete bullshit</h4>
			<p>
				It should be regarded that this module is a revision of what once was a fuckup.
			</p>
			<p>I sincerely apologize. I really do. I'm sorry.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h2>Fonts</h2>
		<p>
			I had to make a plethora of fonts to support the different heading styles and
			whatnot. Don't ask me how long it took.
